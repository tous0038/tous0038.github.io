# Description

To build the portfolio website, I decide to use bootstrap and CSS. The portfolio was designed based on the grid system of all de pages. My first thought was to use bootstrap for the main grid, but in the process, I couldn't find a way to fit the bootstrap grid with the grid of my design. So, I realized that it would be better for this project if a code was written for the grid that would allow it to be used in the other pages that has the same grid. For this reason, I decided to use the property grid-template-area for this project because it is an organized and straightforward way to specify areas within the grid layout. Also, It would be contented to understand the structure taking into account that each layout is very similar, but the images change. After having finished the code and that the web page was working, I realized that I could have used the same class in the images of the different pages and there being able to use a single coding in CSS for the grids of the pages where the images are, it will work. Creating this portfolio taught me that there is more than one way to code to develop the layout, but you need to keeping practice to figure out the best ways to code and consistently apply the best practices.
